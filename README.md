binutils, gcc, mintlib, fdlibm and mintbin for m68k-atari-mint(elf)
===================================================================

This is a set of patches and scripts to download and build GCC and Binutils
packages for Atari and FireBee range of computers running on m68k/ColdFire
CPUs.

After the complete build (`make all`) (which takes about an hour on modern PCs
and takes about 11 GB of disk space) you will get:

- three cross compilers (host to m68000/m68020-60/m5475; installed in
  `$INSTALL_DIR/<cpu>`; `INSTALL_DIR` is defined in build.sh)
- three native compilers (m68000/m68020-60/m5475; packaged as .tar.bz2 in
  the `binary-packages` folder)
- supporting tools and libraries for the above

Don't forget to install the gcc prerequisities: texinfo, autotools, bison,
flex etc. Typing `make` is usually what you need: this creates just the
classic m68000 cross compiler. `make clean` erases everything except
downloaded archives (and depacked source folders).

When it comes to the cross compilers, there's very little difference -- all
of them produce m68k/ColdFire code, the only difference is which one is
produced by default (this has meaning only if you want to compile a native
compiler).

Native compilers are a bit different, though. Not only they produce code for
the given CPU by default but each of them is also optimized (built) for the
given CPU. I.e. the m68020-60 build produces code for m68020-60 by default,
it's compiled with `-m68020-60` optimizations and uses `<prefix>/m68000` and
`<prefix>/m5475` as the multilib directories (m68020-60 is located in
`<prefix>`).

Remember, when using an optimized (non-68000) build, the 'standard' (from
mintlib point of view) multilib hierarchy no longer applies! My builds have
started to follow the standard multilib configuration which is:

`<prefix>/lib` for the CPU gcc is built for

`<prefix>/lib/<cpu>` for the other targets (CPUs)

I.e. for m68000 nothing has changed but for the optimized builds (esp.
ColdFire) you must be careful to put your own libraries into correct
directories.
